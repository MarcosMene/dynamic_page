# dynamic_page

For this litle project, the idea was to create dynamic animations and transitions with Javascript libraries: Scrool Magic and GSAP Green sock and Barba. With them I could create animations and the transitions from one page to another, control the scrool of the page, animate the color of a text with hover action and create a transition with colorfull wipe.
